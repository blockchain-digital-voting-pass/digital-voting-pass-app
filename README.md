Part of a [Delft Unversity of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl) bachelor's thesis about the digitalization of the voting pass for Dutch elections using **blockchain** and **machine readable travel documents**.

The scope of this project is limited to the [voting pass](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stempas) only and forms one step towards the digitalization of the entire voting process. 

This app is intended for use at the polling station. An official scans a voter's travel document to verify and redeem the suffrage, which process is stored on the blockchain and can be verifed by anyone. After the suffrage is verified, a ballot is handed out and the voting process continues in a traditional way (by pencil and paper).

## Getting Started

Import the root folder into your IDE (tested on Android Studio), then run project.

Connects to 188.226.149.56, which acts as a node in the digital voting pass blockchain network. See [digital-voting-pass-multichain](https://github.com/digital-voting-pass/digital-voting-pass-multichain) on how to setup your own node.

This server also hosts a blockchain explorer, which can be accesses here: [http://188.226.149.56:2750/](http://188.226.149.56:2750/).
